    <h1>Features of Java</h1>
    <hr > 
    <p align = left>
        1.  Platform independence: Java is a “write once, run anywhere” language, meaning that Java code can run without any changes on any platform that supports Java. <br>
        2.  Object-oriented language: Java is an object-oriented language that enables programmers to create modular, reusable code components known as objects, making it simpler to develop and maintain complex programmes. <br>
        3.  Automatic memory management: Java includes an automatic memory management mechanism that relieves developers of the need to manually handle memory allocation and deallocation. <br>
        4.  Security: Java contains built-in security measures that can block unauthorised access and shield users from potential security risks. Java was created with security in mind. <br>
        5.  Rich API: The Java standard library has a sizable number of classes and methods, giving programmers a wide range of practical tools for creating applications. <br>
        6.  Multi-threading support: Support for multithreading is integrated into Java, enabling programmers to create concurrent applications that can handle running several threads at once. <br>
        7.  High performance: Java is renowned for having a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, which optimises code execution while it is running. <br>
        8.  Scalability: Java’s modular architecture and object-oriented programming make it simpler to create large-scale programmes that can be scaled up or down based on demand. <br>
        9.  Simplified syntax: Java has a syntax that is simpler than other programming languages, making it simpler for developers to write and read code. </p>

        <h1>What is a full stack developer</h1>
        <p>
            A software engineer that is proficient in both front-end and back-end programming is known as a full-stack developer. They have experience dealing with a variety of web development technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, databases, servers, APIs, and frameworks, among others.
            Let’s take the building of a Facebook-like social media platform as an example. The front-end and back-end of the application would be built by a full-stack developer focusing on this project.
        In order to generate the platform’s visual elements, the developer would design the user interface on the front end using tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, they would leverage front-end frameworks like React or Angular to speed up the development process.
        In order to manage the data and process requests, the developer would write the server-side code using tools like Node.js and PHP. To store user data and other data, they would also employ databases like MySQL or MongoDB.
        The integration of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for functions like authentication, messaging, and notifications would also fall within the purview of a complete stack developer.
        The full-stack developer may make sure that all parts are flawlessly linked and work together as an integrated unit by working on both the front-end and back-end of the social media platform. Because of the wide breadth of technical knowledge and problem-solving skills required, full-stack developers are in high demand in the software development sector.
